# Minesweeper_Plus
In normal Minesweeper, every number tells you how many mines are present in the surrounding 3x3 box. In this version, I added the option to toggle between showing information about the surrounding 3x3, 5x5, or 7x7 box. I also added checks to make impossible situations in games far less common. I created this project simply because I had the idea and thought it would be fun to play.
